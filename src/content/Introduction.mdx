# Introduction

This is the setting of my West Marches-style, up to 12 players, tabletop roleplaying game. It will be run using my own homebrew gaming system, HEXQUEST: an amalgamation of Pathfinder, Forbidden Lands, D&D 5e, and some OSR titles such as DCC and 5TD. The system is d20-based but uses simplified math, fewer modifiers, impactful decisions, and lethal zoned combat.
